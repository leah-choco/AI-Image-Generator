### Description:

AI Image Generator allows a user to create a new image, either from their own imagination or from "Surprise Me" button that will populate a random prompt. This app uses Vite.js for the front end with Tailwind for styling. For the back end, I used MongoDB and Express. The API I used is OpenAI.

### Installation:

Run an install in both client and server. You will also need an account with Cloudinary, MongoDB, and OpenAI. Your own credentials should be stored as shown in the env.EXAMPLE.

### Usage:

This app is pure entertainment, but also a great lesson in how OpenAI works.

### Questions:

This app was created by inspiration from JavaScript Mastery on Youtube. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EyIvuigqDoA&list=PLzK7ybKvI8pL5WOddRUspLwJetcFi09hw&index=15&t=7151s.
